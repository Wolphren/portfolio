            <p>
                I am Wade Davenport the 2nd oldest from a family of 5 kids. I love to climb trees, hike, and go camping. 
                I also enjoy reading, anime, and computer games. From a young age, I have been good at math and puzzles 
                so I have been interested in a career in Computers. However, I am not afraid of physical labor and hard 
                work. My parents and Grandparents have both had farms so I have gotten used to taking care of animals and 
                hard work. While my interests are in computers I also have learned many physical skills over the course 
                of my life. I enjoy helping others and am always willing to reach out and help when asked. I enjoy figuring 
                things out and learning new things. I am always open for constructive criticism and want to learn how I 
                can do better and improve myself.
