      <h1>Who am I</h1>
      <p> I am Wade Davenport the 2nd oldest from a family of 5 kids. I love to climb trees, hike, and go camping. I also enjoy reading, anime, and computer games.
        From a young age, I have been good at math and puzzles so I have been interested in a career in Computers. However, I am not afraid of physical labor and hard work. 
        My parents and Grandparents have both had farms so I have gotten used to taking care of animals and hard work. While my interests are in computers I also have learned many physical skills over the course of my life. I enjoy helping others and am always willing to reach out and help when asked. I enjoy figuring things out and learning new things. I am always open for constructive criticism and want to learn how I can do better and improve myself.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I do not have the code for any of my projects at this moment so this will be a placeholder for now
        There will be defined sections for the different types of projects that are completed.
        I plan to add more projects as they become completed in the future in the following format:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Description (possibility of image)</li>
        <li>Link</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am currently working on two different projects at the moment: 
        One is a game where you change the player to the same color as the incoming obstacles which gets increasingly more fast paced the longer you play
        A Zork-esc game where it is mostly text-based and played in a terminal

        I am hoping to complete these games before the end of summer 2024 and finish the prototypes before the end of spring.
